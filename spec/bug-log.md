# Bug log

Append-only ledger for the repo's local `#NN` bug counter. There is **no
GitHub Issues tracker** for this project — bug numbers live in commit
subjects + inline code comments (`Bug #63 — ...`). This file IS the
ledger.

## Conventions

- **Numbering** is monotonic and sequential. Skip a number if a draft
  PR was abandoned, but never reuse one.
- **Allocation**: the operator (or whoever opens the bug) picks the
  next free `#N` by checking `git log --oneline | grep -oE '#[0-9]+' | sort -unr | head -1`
  and adding 1.
- **Status values**:
  - `fixed` — landed on `main` via a tagged commit; no follow-up scope.
  - `partial-fix` — one or more sub-requirements shipped, others pending.
  - `open` — discovered but not yet fixed.
  - `wontfix` — investigated and explicitly closed without code change.
- **Status anchor**: every row links the **landing commit hash(es)**
  (and a feature folder when one exists).
- **Append-only**: do not rewrite past rows; if a `fixed` bug regresses,
  open a new `#NN` and link to the prior row in its body.

## Bugs

### `#54` — Lab Run errors invisible; cold-start tuple missing
**Status**: fixed
**Commit**: `799543a fix(lab): #54 Run errors now visible; cold-start = v0.sma × BTCUSDT`
**Area**: `lab-end-to-end-v2` (UI error surfacing + default scenario tuple).
**Notes**: Lab Run errors were swallowed by the runner; cockpit cold-start had no default strategy × pair. Now defaults to `v0.sma × BTCUSDT`.

### `#56` — Backtest config path not workspace-relative
**Status**: fixed
**Commit**: `47bb6d3 fix(backtest): #56 workspace-relative config path resolution`
**Area**: `crates/backtest` (path resolution).
**Notes**: Strategy TOML loader resolved paths relative to CWD instead of workspace root; broke when binaries ran from sub-crate dirs.

### `#57` — D-2.5 per-pair filter missing for cross-sectional Lab runs
**Status**: fixed
**Commit**: `cb065fa feat(lab) + cleanup: #57 D-2.5 per-pair filter; #58 trace state alignment + audit dev-note`
**Area**: `lab-end-to-end-v2` (cross-sectional chart filter).
**Notes**: Top-10 momentum / pairs runs showed all 10 symbols' fills + bars overlapped on the chart. Per-pair filter (operator picks BTCUSDT, sees only BTC's data) ships D-2.5.

### `#58` — Trace state misaligned vs spec rows; audit dev-note gap
**Status**: fixed
**Commit**: `cb065fa` (same commit as #57)
**Area**: `spec hygiene` + `audit`.
**Notes**: `spec/trace.toml` rows out of sync with feature.md frontmatter; companion audit dev-note describing the cleanup.

### `#60` — Audit P2/P3 sweep
**Status**: fixed (ops sweep)
**Commit**: `a7f9b10 ops: #60 audit P2/P3 sweep`
**Area**: spec hygiene (P2 / P3 audit findings cleanup).
**Notes**: Mechanical bookkeeping pass over outstanding audit P2/P3 items. Not a code bug — used the #NN counter for traceability.

### `#61` — `lab-yahoo-realdata` v0.1.1 anchor scaffolding
**Status**: partial-fix
**Commit**: `b78cf97 feat(lab-yahoo): #61 v0.1.1 partial anchor — commit REVISION.toml + scaffold test`
**Area**: `lab-yahoo-realdata` (Yahoo anchor lock).
**Notes**: Test scaffolding + REVISION.toml committed. Final Yahoo anchor lock blocks on operator populating the cache (`cargo run -p data --features yahoo,yahoo-online --bin fetch_yahoo_klines`). Tracked as `lab-yahoo-realdata v0.1.1` row in [`spec/backlog.md ## Active`](backlog.md).

### `#62` — `lab-polish-round-2`: position curve + SMA param editor + KPI density
**Status**: partial-fix (R2 + R3 shipped; R1 in flight)
**Commits**:
- `091c3e9 analyst(lab-polish-round-2): #62 author v0.1.0 spec — position curve + param editor + KPI density`
- `c1cddbe feat(backtest): #62 R2 backend — SmaComposedRunInput.sma_{fast,slow}_len overrides`
- `ae26281 feat(lab): #62 R2 UI — SMA fast/slow param editor`
- `371d870 feat(lab): #62 R3 KPI strip densification — 8 cards in 2×4 layout`

**Area**: `lab-polish-round-2`.
**Notes**: Three operator workflow gaps surfaced after `lab-end-to-end-v2` shipped — R1 position-curve overlay, R2 SMA param editor, R3 KPI strip density. R2 + R3 in `main`; R1 in flight. Feature [`spec/lab-polish-round-2/feature.md`](lab-polish-round-2/feature.md).

### `#63` — Cross-sectional Stop + progress wiring dead; Yahoo fetch could freeze cockpit
**Status**: fixed
**Commit**: `982830f fix(lab): #63 cross-sectional Stop+progress wiring + Yahoo fetch timeout`
**Area**: `lab-end-to-end-v2` follow-up (`crates/backtest/scenarios/` + `crates/ui/src/lab/runner.rs`).
**Notes**: Two regressions left behind by `lab-end-to-end-v2 v0.1.0`:
1. Cross-sectional scenarios (`momentum`, `pairs`, `tcn_overlay`) never took `cancel_rx` / `progress_tx`. Stop button silent; progress bar frozen. Fix threads both through and polls at the 128-bar boundary (`bar_idx.trailing_zeros() >= 7`). CLI passes `cancellation_pair()` with handle alive + `ProgressSender::disabled()` so anchored output is byte-identical by construction.
2. `runner.rs::fetch_with_backoff` had no per-attempt timeout — a hung Yahoo endpoint could freeze the cockpit indefinitely. Added 60 s `tokio::time::timeout` per attempt; retries with backoff up to `max_retries`.

### `#64` — Progress bar stuck for short runs (Yahoo daily Last30d, narrow custom ranges)
**Status**: fixed
**Commit**: _pending — same commit as this row's authoring_
**Area**: `lab-end-to-end-v2` follow-up (`crates/backtest/scenarios/` × 4 + `crates/ui/src/lab/runner.rs`).
**Discovery**: Operator-reported. Synthetic-hourly runs showed smooth animation; Yahoo daily Last30d (~30 bars) stayed visually stuck.

**Root cause** (diagnosed via `tracing::warn!` probes — see `git show 88ea755~..HEAD -- crates/ui/src/lab/progress.rs` for the temporary instrumentation). All 4 scenarios used a sparse poll boundary calibrated for hundred-to-thousand-bar runs:
- SMA path: `bar_idx & 0x1F == 0` (warmup, every 32) → `bar_idx & 0x7F == 0` (steady, every 128).
- Cross-sectional (Bug #63 wiring): `bar_idx.trailing_zeros() >= 7` (every 128).

For a 30-bar Yahoo daily Last30d run, only `bar_idx = 0` hit the boundary. One progress event fires with `current_bar=0, total_bars=30` → `progress_pct = 0/30 = 0.0` → bar renders at empty fill, never advances before the engine completes in milliseconds. The Yahoo preload phase between channel creation and engine start additionally rendered the 30% indeterminate fallback during the network/disk await.

**Fix** (two parts):
1. **Always emit at the final bar** regardless of poll boundary. In all 4 scenario files (`sma_composed_run.rs`, `momentum.rs`, `pairs.rs`, `tcn_overlay.rs`), the gate now reads `<existing boundary> || bar_idx == total_bars.saturating_sub(1)`. For 30-bar runs this gives 2 emits (bar 0, bar 29) → bar visibly advances 0% → 97% → done. For 720-bar synthetic Last30d hourly the existing 9 emits become 10 — no regression.
2. **Yahoo preload sentinel** — `crates/ui/src/lab/runner.rs::spawn_lab_run` now emits a `Progress { current_bar: 0, total_bars: 1, elapsed_ms: 0 }` event BEFORE the `preload_yahoo_bars` await. The widget renders this as 0% with the label `"0 / 1 bars · 0.0s"` — an explicit pre-engine state instead of the silent indeterminate fallback.

**Anchor contract**: Progress events are channel-only, never written to report bodies. 34/34 anchors stay byte-identical.

**Probes used during diagnosis** (now reverted): `tracing::warn!` at `crates/ui/src/bin/cockpit_live.rs:1200` (LabRunRequested handler) + `crates/ui/src/lab/progress.rs::Recipe::stream()` (entry + rx_opt = Some/None branch). Captured to `/tmp/cockpit-probes.log` via `RUST_LOG=lab.progress.recipe=warn`. Probe log showed salt bump 1→2→3 across runs with `rx_opt = Some` every time — ruling out the iced subscription as the failure mode.
